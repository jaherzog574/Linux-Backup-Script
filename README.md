# Basic Linux Backup Script
BASH script that runs on Linux and does backups of the specifeid directory and sends the user an email when done with a log of 
what it's done when finshed.

Make sure that when you download the script that you change the source, destination, log file name, and email address to your
needs (these are all found at the top of the file).

If you wish to automate this script, then tell Chon to run it and give it the times that it should run at (look online if you are
unfamilier with Cron).
